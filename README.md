This is the implementation of CTSPARQL, two ontology and constraint reasoning based methods for the discovery and diagnosis of wrong queries in SPARQL. The first method is used for detecting wrongly typed and unsatisfiable queries. 
The second method is used for detecting mismatching between user intention and queries, reporting incomplete, faulty queries as well as counterexamples.
